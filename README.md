Translucent
===========

Turn any image into PNG file with a translucent pixel so that Twitter won't use JPEG for your image.

[Try the app](http://kosamari.github.io/translucent).

## Why?
Twitter use JPEG to any opaque image uploaded regardless of original file format (which drives me nuts ðŸ˜–), exception is PNG with transparency. This app will turn a single pixel on top left corner to 99.6% opacity (hardly any different from original) and export as PNG.

Please see below for sample result, you can see opaque image upload gets pretty rough JPEG artifacts. (original [tweet is here](https://twitter.com/kosamari/status/722299200239706113))

## Electron App Archive

This app started as an electron app, but I was quickly asked by Jake ["why not web?"](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/722320408804986882). To be honest, I never really opened electron app and always used the website to do image converting. For some memory, archive of the electron app is [available here](https://github.com/kosamari/translucent/blob/master/electronapp_archive.zip).


### Dependency
In order to run this from source, you'll need electron installed.
`npm install -g electron`

### To start
```
cd [repo's directory]
npm install
electron .
```

### To build .app file
```
cd [repo's directory]
electron-packager . translucent --platform=darwin --arch=x64 --version=0.36.1 --icon=translucent.icns
```
